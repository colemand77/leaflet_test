# rig-leaflet
This is a test of the Shiny system to explore
* how the shiny package works
* how git/github works
* how to build a moderately(?) useful dynamic visualization online (using Baker Hughes Rig Count information)
* some stuff about CSS
* some stuff about JS
* how bad I am at coding now
* how much better I may be (one day)
